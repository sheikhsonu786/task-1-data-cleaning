# Data Cleaning Summary – Sales Dataset

## Objective:
Clean and prepare the retail sales dataset downloaded from Kaggle for further analysis and visualization.

---

## Cleaning Steps Performed:

1. **Column Headers Formatting**
   - Removed extra spaces from column headers
   - Converted all headers to lowercase for consistency

2. **Missing and Duplicate Data Handling**
   - Used `COUNTBLANK()` to identify empty cells
   - Checked for duplicates and removed them to maintain data integrity

3. **Data Type Corrections**
   - Converted `order_value_eur` and `cost` columns to number format
   - Adjusted decimal places properly

4. **Date Format Fixing**
   - Some dates were in text format, so fixed them using:
     - `Data` → `Text to Columns` → Delimited → Next → Next → Date (MDY) → Finish
     - Then applied custom format: `dd-mm-yyyy`
   - Ensured all dates are right-aligned (i.e., proper date values)

5. **Formula Used for Validation**
   - Used `ISTEXT()` and `ISNUMBER()` to check data types
   - Used `COUNTBLANK()` to count missing values

6. **Table Conversion**
   - Converted entire dataset to an Excel table for better filtering, sorting, and formatting

7. **Final Save Format**
   - Saved the cleaned file as `.xlsx` format for compatibility and submission
